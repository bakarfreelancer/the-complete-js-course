There are two students 'ali' and 'Shan'.
The marks of each student are as below:
Ali's Marks:
    - English:  90
    - Urdu:     60
    - Pashto:   85
    - Maths:    30
    - Science:  70

Shan's Marks:
    - English:  70
    - Urdu:     40
    - Pashto:   35
    - Maths:    30
    - Science:  20
Create variables for each subject marks. (aliEnglishMarks)

1) Calculate the total marks of each student and save in two variables, 'aliTotalMarks' and 'shanTotalMarks'.
2) Also find average marks of each student and store in variables 'aliAverageMarks' and 'shanAverageMarks'.
   Average = (English + Urdu + Pashto + Maths + Science) / 5
3) Create boolean variable 'isShanPassed' and stored result of the statement 'Shan average marks is greater than 45';
4) Compare both students total marks and do not store it in variable, directly print it on console.
5) Print all results to console.

Use your previous Ali and Shan results example and solve the given problems
1) Check if shan's marks is greater than ali's marks print "Shan marks is greater and total marks = (shan's marks)", else print "Ali Marks is greater and total marks = (ali's marks)" to console.
2) Print both students average marks to console with template literals as : 
    "Ali average marks = 'aliAverageMarks' and Shan average marks = 'shanAverageMarks'".
